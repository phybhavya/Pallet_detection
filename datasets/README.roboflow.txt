The dataset includes 1245 images.
Pallet-detecction are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -16 and +16 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
